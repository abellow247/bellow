          *After reading you might find an interest

          or another interesting hobby that you 
          are completely obsessed over *<br><br>



          My coding journey.<br><br>

          Being a retail manager for 10 + years, Never had a thought of doing anything 
          else as that consumed a large portion of my life. I randomly stumbled upon 
          a YouTube video about the basics of coding. 
          I really didn't know why that would be useful or interesting, 
          but I thought I'd give it a try. After all i was literally printing 
          “hello world” for the first time couldn't be hard right? 
          I opened my laptop and wrote my first line of code. 
          I tried 3 times to print something so simple to the console after all the syntax errors. 
          I finally got my code to work and as I sat there wondering what 
          I did wrong the first couple times, I got hooked and wanted to get better at something that seemed so easy 
          at a glance , but so hard to actually execute. and yeah , it was a moment that I would never take back.<br>
          <br>Getting a piece of electronic equipment to perform a task, or make a game you enjoy, 
          or create a visual stunning experience.. I was hooked. I have always been creative and appreciated 
          others creativity. We are all creators at one point or another. Coding combines precise knowledge, 
          creativity, problem solving skills, and devotion in order to thrive. 
          In reality, there's a lot of factors that shift your outcome. (Getting a job you've always wanted, 
          being considered for a certain position, etc.) & there's always other people's opinions interfering. 
          Not with computer programming.. it's very linear . It's either wrong or right. (Or in my case, true or false) 
          Thats what I love about it. I have complete control of my end result.<br><br>
